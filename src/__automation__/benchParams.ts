/**
 * Bench-runner params composition.
 *
 * The matrix runner owns the native context lifecycle end-to-end and never
 * routes through `modelStore.contextInitParams` / `modelStore.initContext`.
 * That isolation removes three classes of failure that earlier shared-state
 * designs hit:
 *
 *   1. Cold-launch auto-load shadowing — when the bench shared the store,
 *      `ChatView`'s `selectModel(palDefaultModel)` could load the model
 *      with default devices BEFORE the matrix could call `setDevices(...)`,
 *      and `initContext`'s "already loaded → skip" path silently dropped
 *      the runner's per-cell intent.
 *   2. Cross-cell MMKV leak — a previous cell's persisted `n_gpu_layers`
 *      could carry into the next cell unless explicitly pinned and then
 *      restored at matrix exit. The pin/restore machinery was a
 *      symptom-level patch.
 *   3. Crash-corruption — if the matrix threw mid-flight, the user's
 *      persisted Settings would be left in whatever transient state the
 *      last cell wrote.
 *
 * Under this module's contract:
 *   - The runner reads NOTHING from `modelStore`.
 *   - The runner writes NOTHING to `modelStore`.
 *   - Per-cell params are a pure literal: base ⊕ overrides ⊕ backend slot.
 *
 * `n_threads` is the one device-dependent default. The runner resolves it
 * once at matrix start via `getRecommendedThreadCount()` (a pure utility,
 * not store-coupled) and threads it into the base.
